MongoDB Query Runner for Neovim

A lightweight neovim plugin, tailored to fit my needs.  
In my daily work, I execute numerous MongoDB queries. Tools like `mongosh` or `MongoDB Atlas` are powerful but feel sluggish - mainly because of lack of vim motions support (unacceptable!).  

Using this tool I am able to run MongoDB queries without leaving my editor, also I can just store all the queries in one file and execute queries by simply selecting them


## TO DO

- [ ] Built-in paging support (no idea how to implement it as for now)
